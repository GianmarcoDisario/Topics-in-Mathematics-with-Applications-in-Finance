# Topics-in-Mathematics-with-Applications-in-Finance
I am currently working through the MIT course ["Topics in Mathematics with Applications in Finance"](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-s096-topics-in-mathematics-with-applications-in-finance-fall-2013/index.htm).

The main point will be working through the problem sets. These can be found in the `notebooks` directory starting with `PS`.
